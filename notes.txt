*** BASICS ***

All components are server components in next by default
To make a client components in next we need to add ||"use-client" at top level of component
Hooks can not be used in server components

*** ROUTING ***
All routes must be placed inside App folder
every component should name as page.js or page.tsx in order to make it available as route
   folder name => blog=>page.tsx , route will be available as localhost:3000/blog

For nested routes make folder inside folder 
   folder name ===> blog=>FirstPage=>page.tsx , route will be available as localhost:3000/blog/FirstPage

Next does not create route of those whose folder name starts with underscore "_" like _blog etc
these type of folders is used to create helpers functions like _config, _utils => services.ts

For Dynamic nested routes like products/productid (productid can be any like 4 5 or any key string)
    create folder using square bracket inside your screen folder like products => [productid] => page.tsx
    to get productid like we do in react using useparams . In next this id can be provided by default in component props like 
    export default function ProductDetails({ params }) { }

If dynamic nested routes is long like docs/feature/feature1/reviews/reviews1.... and go on 
    then we need to create folder structure like folder  => docs => [[...slug]] (can be any name instead of slug)
    if we create folder with single square brackets [...slug] then localhost:3000/docs will not work but docs/feature/feature1... will work
    to handle this we need add two square  brackets [[...slug]]
    Now params will return an  array of string containing list whatever the nested route is .
    if route is docs/feature/feature1/reviews/reviews1 params will give list like ['feature','feature1','reviews','reviews1' ]
    (e.g => docs folder)

Custom Not Found Route component
    For global not found component add component with name not-found.tsx in app folder with layout.tsx

If scenario is if productid is greater tha n 100 than also show not found component for that
        import { notFound } from 'next/navigation'
        export default function ProductDetails({ params } : { params : { productid : string }}) {
            if(Number(params.productid) > 100){
                return notFound()
            }
            return <h1>Product Details {params.productid}</h1>
        }
    it will show global not-found component . but in order show specific screen than create not-found.tsx in that specific component folder 
    like products => [productid] => not-found.tsx
    Now those routes with products/ANY_INVALID_ROUTE will show this specific not found component

ROUTE ACROSS SCREENS
In order to navigate across screens use link tag and pass url in href attribute.
the next/router and next/navigation can't be used in server component to use it we need to change component from server to client.
Routing and navigation, such as using router.push() or router.replace(), is a client-side operation  that modifies the URL in the browser 
and updates the history state. Since Server Components run on the server (where there's no browser or history stack),
they cannot interact with the client-side router directly.

FILE BASE NAVIGATION
link tag is used for navigation e.g. <Link href='product/3'>Product 3</Link>
    if we use replace like <Link href='product/3' replace>Product 3</Link> then when we route back it will redirect to home route
    because it clear the navigation history of browser
useRouter is used to navigation as well like const router = useRouter() then router.push(_ROUTE) like in react

*** LAYOUT ***
Layout.tsx in root folder of app behave as to general layout that need to display in all screen like header and footer
to display layout for multiple specific routes create layout.tsx in that specific folder  if we create layout.tsx in Product folder 
then that JSX will display in all routes that starts with product like product/ProductDetails, product/ProductDetails/1 ...etc

For Group Layout create folder with (folder_name) and add layout.tsx in it now every folder that is present in this folder
will display this specific layout. (e.g => product folder)

*** TEMPLATE.tsx & LAYOUT.tsx ***
If we have a folder name auth that contains login , register and forget password
these all components shares common layout.tsx that will appear oall of these routes
whenver we navigate b/w these routes layout.tsx does not rerender or remounted 
If we have a textfield in layout.tsx and we fill it with some text from login page and then we route 
to register page field holds that value of textfield as layout.tsx does not rerender or unmounted when we route from one to another
so in order to overcome this we can just rename layout.tsx to template.tsx .
The template.tsx rerendered on each route change.
We can place both template and layout at a time.

*** LOADING.tsx ***
Just layout and template behaves as global for specific or global we can add loading.tsx as well.
it will work  react suspense fallback loader.
if we place loading.tsx globally and also inside specific folder than global loading will be override.

*** ERROR.tsx ***
Error.tsx behaves as error boundary . It should be a client component
    It can be global if we create it alongside global page.tsx
    It can be component specific aswell if we create it alongside page.tsx of specific folder
RESET ERROR FUNCTION
    Just like error.tsx provide error props it also provide reset function props.
    It purpose is to rerender the component again in which error is occured.
    for that we need to create that component as client component as well.
